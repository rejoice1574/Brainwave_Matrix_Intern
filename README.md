### **1. ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.
**Key Features:**
-   Utilizes a classification model to flag suspicious transactions.
-   Addresses challenges of imbalanced data through appropriate techniques.
-   Deploys the model in a Flask web application for real-time predictions.

### **2. ðŸ“° Fake News Detector**
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify news articles as "real" or "fake" based on their content.
**Key Features:**
-   Applies text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques (e.g., TF-IDF).
-   Trains a classification model to detect linguistic patterns of misinformation.
-   Provides a web interface for a user to input an article and get a prediction.

**How to Run the Projects:**
Each project is contained within its own folder. To run a specific project, navigate to its directory in your terminal, install its `requirements.txt` dependencies, and follow the instructions in its local `README.md` or main Python script.
